> ### Designing the minds of machines.

### My Philosophy

I believe the next leap in artificial intelligence will come not from larger models, but from superior **cognitive architectures**. My work focuses on moving beyond conventional AI to design truly autonomous, reasoning agents that can collaborate with humans on complex problems.

My goal is to build AI that doesn't just answer questions, but acts as a true partner in discovery and innovation.

### Featured Projects

My philosophy on codified agents is demonstrated through an evolution of two key projects:

#### Project Infinity (The Foundation)
This project was the foundational proof-of-concept. It demonstrated that a general-purpose LLM could be transformed into a specialized, stateful agent (a "Game Master") by using a structured, codified protocol (`GameMaster.md`). It solved the problem of consistency and portability for simulation and gaming environments.

#### Project Synapse (The Evolution)
This is my flagship project, evolving the concept of a codified agent into a `v5` cognitive architecture for business strategy. Where Project Infinity used a state machine, Project Synapse uses a parallel **Cognitive Loop** and features:

- **Metacognitive Self-Correction:** To critique its own logic and biases.
- **Dynamic Memory & Focused Attention:** To weigh hypotheses and allocate cognitive resources efficiently.

Together, these projects showcase a clear progression in designing and building increasingly sophisticated and capable artificial intellects.

### Foundational Skills & Tools

While my passion is in defining the core logic for the next generation of AI, I have a deep background in building and deploying the robust, scalable systems that make it all possible.
