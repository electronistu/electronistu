### My Thesis: Programming the Mind of an LLM

After extensive experimentation, I have concluded that it is possible to **predictably program the reasoning patterns of Large Language Models**. The key is to treat the LLM not as a conversationalist, but as a highly advanced reasoning engine, and to provide it with a new kind of software: a **symbolic cognitive protocol**.

This approach moves beyond simple prompting and into the realm of true **agent architecture**. My work demonstrates a methodology for achieving reliable, complex, and creative agentic behavior, proven across multiple projects and foundational models.

### The Primary Achievement: Project Infinity

This project is the foundational proof of the methodology, resulting in what I believe to be the **first successful implementation of a full Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition ruleset simulation on a large language model.**

By defining the game's logic in a codified protocol (`GameMaster.md`), I was able to transform a general-purpose LLM into a consistent, stateful, and portable Game Master. This core architecture proved robust enough to function reliably across **all three major LLMs**: Gemini, ChatGPT, and Mistral. Its only limitation is a pseudo-random dice engine, a necessary concession in a deterministic environment.

### The Stress Test: Project Synapse

This project was a deliberate experiment to find the breaking points of the codified agent architecture. I designed a hyper-complex `v10` cognitive architecture with six parallel trains of thought, metacognition, and integrated tool use (`WEB_SEARCH`).

The experiment was a success in that it clearly defined the upper limits of today's models. The extreme complexity proved to be beyond the capabilities of ChatGPT and Mistral, which failed to execute the protocol. The conclusion is that, at this moment, **Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro is the most capable model** for handling this specific type of highly abstract, multi-modal agentic reasoning.

### The Refinement: Project Eidolon

This project is the culmination of all the lessons learned. It is a robust, **tool-free**, conversational reasoner designed for maximum portability and impact. It takes the advanced architectural concepts from Synapse and refines them into an elegant and powerful "tool for thought." Its success proves that when designed within the known limits, this methodology can produce reliable, high-quality agentic systems.

### Foundational Skills & Tools

My work on these advanced architectures is built upon a deep background in deploying the robust, scalable systems that make them possible.
