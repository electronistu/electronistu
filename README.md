### My Thesis: Programming the Mind of an LLM

After extensive experimentation, I have concluded that it is possible to **predictably program the reasoning patterns of Large Language Models**. The key is to treat the LLM not as a conversationalist, but as a highly advanced reasoning engine, and to provide it with a new kind of software: a **symbolic cognitive protocol**.

My work is a journey of discovery, culminating in a methodology for creating elegant, robust, and universally portable AI agents.

### The Journey: A Three-Act Story in Agent Architecture

My methodology was refined over three distinct projects, each representing a critical step in the journey.

#### Act I: The Foundational Success (Project Infinity)

This project was the foundational proof of the methodology. It resulted in the **first successful implementation of a full Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition ruleset simulation on a large language model.** By defining the game's logic in a codified protocol, I created a consistent and stateful Game Master that was fully portable across all three major LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT, and Mistral). It proved that complex, rule-bound systems could be reliably simulated.

#### Act II: The Lesson in Complexity (Project Synapse)

This was a brief but valuable experiment to explore the upper limits of complexity. I designed a hyper-complex agent with multiple parallel cognitive loops and an explicit, tool-based `WEB_SEARCH` directive. The protocol's failure to be portable was not a failure of the LLMs, but a crucial design lesson: an over-engineered, tool-dependent architecture is brittle and unnecessary when the underlying models have powerful, implicit capabilities.

#### Act III: The Refined Application (Project Eidolon)

This project is the culmination of all the lessons learned. It is a robust, **tool-free**, conversational reasoner designed for maximum portability and impact. It takes the proven portability of Infinity and combines it with the advanced cognitive concepts of Synapse, but implements them in a simple and elegant way. Its success on all major foundational models is the definitive proof of the refined methodology: **the best agent protocol is the one that trusts the underlying intelligence of the model, guiding its reasoning rather than micro-managing its actions.**

### Foundational Skills & Tools

My work on these advanced architectures is built upon a deep background in deploying the robust, scalable systems that make them possible.
