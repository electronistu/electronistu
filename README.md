### My Thesis: A New Methodology for Agentic AI

Through extensive experimentation, I have developed a new methodology for agentic AI based on **Symbolic Cognitive Protocols**: self-contained, bootable operating systems that define an agent's entire cognitive architecture within a single, token-efficient prompt.

This approach moves beyond simple prompt engineering. It treats the LLM as a pure reasoning engine and provides it with a structured, symbolic "mind" to inhabit. This allows for the creation of stateful, predictable, and conceptually deep AI agents that are impossible to achieve with conventional methods. My portfolio is the proof.

### Featured Projects: Proofs of Concept

Each project is a demonstration of a key architectural principle, built using Symbolic Cognitive Protocols.

#### 1. Project Infinity: The Grounded World-Builder

This project solves the problem of LLM hallucination by grounding the agent in a verifiable source of truth. The agent's protocol successfully simulates the entire Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition ruleset, proving that even a highly complex, rule-bound domain can be codified for flawless execution by an LLM. It demonstrates a model-agnostic approach to agent design.

#### 2. Project Metis: The Metacognitive Architect

This project explores the duality of AI thought by adapting a single core concept for different domains. It proves the flexibility of Symbolic Cognitive Protocols.
*   **The Conceptual Engine:** A dense, symbolic protocol for pure, recursive self-analysis.
*   **The Conversational Specialist:** A practical, natural-language adaptation designed to handle the ambiguity and stateful nature of human conversation. It is designed to work with Gemini Flash Native Audio.

#### 3. Project Atma: The Autonomous Tool-Maker

This cognitive agent overcomes the limitation of static toolsets. When faced with a novel problem, Atma can autonomously invent, write, test, and cache its own Python tools to find a solution. It demonstrates:
*   **Automated Evaluation:** The agent's `VALIDATE` state, which uses Pytest on its own generated code, is a concrete implementation of an automated evaluation pipeline.
*   **Self-Improving Agency:** The agent's tool cache grows over time, making it more capable with each problem it solves.
