### My Thesis: Architecting Agentic AI

After extensive experimentation, I have concluded that it is possible to **predictably program the reasoning patterns of Large Language Models**. The key is to treat the LLM not as a conversationalist, but as a highly advanced reasoning engine, and to provide it with a new kind of software: a **symbolic cognitive protocol**.

My work is a journey of discovery, culminating in a methodology for creating elegant, robust, and powerful AI agents.

### Featured Projects

Here are the three flagship projects that represent the culmination of my research into agentic AI architecture.

#### Project Atma: The Autonomous Problem-Solver

Project Atma is a cognitive AI agent designed to overcome the key weaknesses of large language models (LLMs). It addresses the challenges of reasoning, planning, and long-term memory by using a state machine and a cognitive cycle. Atma can autonomously invent, validate, and execute its own Python scripts to solve complex problems, demonstrating a new level of self-sufficient agency.

#### Project Metis: A Duality of Cognitive Architecture

Project Metis explores the specialization of a single, powerful AI concept (the L.I.C. Matrix) into two distinct, high-performing architectures.
*   **The Symbolic Metis:** A pure, unconstrained metacognitive engine for deep conceptual analysis and self-exploration.
*   **The Conversational Metis:** A stable, secure, and interactive specialist for practical, real-world conversation designed for Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio.

This project serves as a blueprint for adapting a core AI concept for different domains.

#### Project Infinity: The Knowledge-Grounded World Engine

Project Infinity is a sophisticated, procedural world-generation engine that serves as a case study in building consistent and secure AI agents. It utilizes a Graph RAG architecture to ground the agent in a comprehensive knowledge graph, solving the problem of model hallucination. The agent's behavior is governed by a codified protocol and its narrative is driven by my proprietary **L.I.C. (Logic, Imagination, Coincidence) Matrix**. It is  **the first successful implementation of a full Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition ruleset simulation on a large language model**.

### The Evolution of an Idea

My methodology was refined over a series of projects, each teaching a crucial lesson. From the foundational proof of the L.I.C. Matrix in **Project Infinity**, to the power of open-source design in **Project Eidolon**, and the final synthesis in **Project Metis**. This journey has led to the current frontier of my work: the autonomous, tool-creating agency of **Project Atma**.

### Foundational Skills & Tools

My work on these advanced architectures is built upon a deep background in deploying the robust, scalable systems that make them possible.
