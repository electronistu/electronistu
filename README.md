> ### Designing the minds of machines.

### My Philosophy

I believe the next leap in artificial intelligence will come not from larger models, but from superior **cognitive architectures**. My work focuses on creating AI that acts as a powerful, complementary tool for human thoughtâ€”a sparring partner for the mind that helps us see our own ideas in new and challenging ways.

My goal is to build AI that doesn't just give answers, but enhances our own ability to think.

### Featured Project: Project Eidolon

This philosophy is embodied in my latest work, **Project Eidolon**, a "Cognitive Refractor." This agent takes a single user concept and refracts it through six distinct intellectual domains (from Physics to Philosophy, including a creative **Divergent** lens) to reveal hidden assumptions, biases, and new avenues for innovation. It's a powerful, conversational tool for stress-testing ideas and augmenting human creativity.

### The Evolution of an Idea

My work represents a clear progression in designing increasingly robust and sophisticated agentic systems:

1.  **Project Infinity (The Foundation):** This project proved that a codified protocol could transform a general-purpose LLM into a consistent, stateful agent for complex simulations.

2.  **Project Synapse (The Architect):** This project evolved the concept into a `v10` cognitive architecture, creating a powerful AI strategist with six parallel trains of thought. It also successfully mapped the frontiers of current LLMs, revealing the challenges of abstraction and tool use at the highest levels.

3.  **Project Eidolon (The Tool):** This is the culmination of all previous lessons. It is an agent designed for maximum impact and portability by being a pure, tool-free, conversational reasoner. It takes the advanced cognitive framework of Synapse and refines it into an elegant, powerful, and universally applicable tool for thought.

### Foundational Skills & Tools

While my passion is in defining the core logic for the next generation of AI, I have a deep background in building and deploying the robust, scalable systems that make it all possible.
